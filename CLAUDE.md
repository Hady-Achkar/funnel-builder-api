# Claude Development Guide

## IMPORTANT: Planning Context

- Always check next_plan.md first when starting work
- If the user's request relates to Business/Agency plans implementation, refer to next_plan.md
- If unrelated to the plan, continue with normal workflow

## Development Workflow

- Create a script to push to GitHub and push to develop branch
- Verify and ensure .gitignore is correctly configured to exclude unnecessary files
